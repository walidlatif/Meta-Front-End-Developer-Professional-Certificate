## Introduction

Welcome to the HTML and CSS Basics module! In this module, we will cover the fundamental concepts of web development using HTML and CSS. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure and content of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the presentation and layout of those web pages.

## HTML Basics

HTML is a markup language that consists of a series of elements and tags. These elements form the building blocks of web pages. We will start by learning the basic structure of an HTML document, how to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

## CSS Basics

CSS is a style sheet language that allows you to define the appearance of HTML elements. We will explore how to use CSS selectors, properties, and values to apply styles to elements. Additionally, we will cover concepts like cascading, inheritance, and specificity.

## Putting It All Together

In this section, we will combine our knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a simple web page. We will demonstrate how to build a basic web page and apply styling to make it visually appealing.
